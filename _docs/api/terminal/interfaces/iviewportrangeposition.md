###  x

**● x**: *`number`*

*Defined in [xterm.d.ts:911](https://github.com/Tyriar/xterm.js/blob/4.3.0/typings/xterm.d.ts#L911)*

The x position of the cell. This is a 0-based index that refers to the space in between columns, not the column itself. Index 0 refers to the left side of the viewport, index `Terminal.cols` refers to the right side of the viewport. This can be thought of as how a cursor is positioned in a text editor.
