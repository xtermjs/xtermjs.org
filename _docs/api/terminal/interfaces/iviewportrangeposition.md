# Interface: IViewportRangePosition

An object representing a cell position within the viewport of the terminal.

## Properties

### x

> **x**: `number`

The x position of the cell. This is a 0-based index that refers to the
space in between columns, not the column itself. Index 0 refers to the
left side of the viewport, index `Terminal.cols` refers to the right side
of the viewport. This can be thought of as how a cursor is positioned in
a text editor.

### y

The y position of the cell. This is a 0-based index that refers to a
specific row.
