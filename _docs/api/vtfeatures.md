## General notes

This document lists xterm.js' support of terminal sequences. The sequences are grouped by their sequence type:

- C0: single byte command (7bit control codes, byte range `\x00` .. `\x1F`, `\x7F`)
- C1: single byte command (8bit control codes, byte range `\x80` .. `\x9F`)
- ESC: sequence starting with `ESC` (`\x1B`)
- CSI - Control Sequence Introducer: sequence starting with `ESC [` (7bit) or CSI (`\x9B`, 8bit)
- DCS - Device Control String: sequence starting with `ESC P` (7bit) or DCS (`\x90`, 8bit)
- OSC - Operating System Command: sequence starting with `ESC ]` (7bit) or OSC (`\x9D`, 8bit)

Application Program Command (APC), Privacy Message (PM) and Start of String (SOS) are recognized but not supported,
any sequence of these types will be ignored. They are also not hookable by the API.

Note that the list only contains sequences implemented in xterm.js' core codebase. Missing sequences are either
not supported or unstable/experimental. Furthermore addons or integrations can provide additional custom sequences.

To denote the sequences the tables use the same abbreviations as xterm does:
- `Ps`: A single (usually optional) numeric parameter, composed of one or more decimal digits.
- `Pm`: A multiple numeric parameter composed of any number of single numeric parameters, separated by ; character(s),
  e.g. ` Ps ; Ps ; ... `.
- `Pt`: A text parameter composed of printable characters. Note that for most commands with `Pt` only
  ASCII printables are specified to work. Additionally the parser will let pass any codepoint greater than C1 as printable.



## C0

<section class="sequence-details">

### Bell
The behavior of the bell is further customizable with `ITerminalOptions.bellStyle`
and `ITerminalOptions.bellSound`.


</section>
<section class="sequence-details">

### Backspace
By default it is not possible to move the cursor past the leftmost position.
If `reverse wrap-around` (`CSI ? 45 h`) is set, a previous soft line wrap (DECAWM)
can be undone with BS within the scroll margins. In that case the cursor will wrap back
to the end of the previous row. Note that it is not possible to peek back into the scrollbuffer
with the cursor, thus at the home position (top-leftmost cell) this has no effect.


</section>
<section class="sequence-details">

### Line Feed
Scrolling is restricted to scroll margins and will only happen on the bottom line.

### Delete Character
As characters are deleted, the remaining characters between the cursor and right margin move to the left.
Character attributes move with the characters. The terminal adds blank characters at the right margin.

### Select Graphic Rendition
SGR selects one or more character attributes at the same time. Multiple params (up to 32)
are applied in order from left to right. The changed attributes are applied to all new
characters received. If you move characters in the viewport by scrolling or any other means,
then the attributes move with the characters.

Supported param values by SGR:

| Param     | Meaning                                                  | Support |

### Soft Terminal Reset
There are two terminal reset sequences - RIS and DECSTR. While RIS performs almost a full terminal bootstrap,
DECSTR only resets certain attributes. For most needs DECSTR should be sufficient.

The following terminal attributes are reset to default values:
- IRM is reset (dafault = false)
- scroll margins are reset (default = viewport size)
- erase attributes are reset to default
- charsets are reset
- DECSC data is reset to initial values
- DECOM is reset to absolute mode


</section>
<section class="sequence-details">

### Set Cursor Style
Supported cursor styles:
 - empty, 0 or 1: steady block
 - 2: blink block
 - 3: steady underline
 - 4: blink underline
 - 5: steady bar
 - 6: blink bar


</section>
<section class="sequence-details">

### Insert Columns
DECIC inserts `Ps` times blank columns at the cursor position for all lines with the scroll margins,
moving content to the right. Content at the right margin is lost.
DECIC has no effect outside the scrolling margins.


</section>
<section class="sequence-details">

### Delete Columns
DECDC deletes `Ps` times columns at the cursor position for all lines with the scroll margins,
moving content to the left. Blank columns are added at the right margin.
DECDC has no effect outside the scrolling margins.

<section class="sequence-details">

### Set Windows Title
xterm.js does not manipulate the title directly, instead exposes changes via the event `Terminal.onTitleChange`.


</section>
<section class="sequence-details">

### Set ANSI color
`c` is the color index between 0 and 255. `spec` color format is 'rgb:hh/hh/hh' where `h` are hexadecimal digits.
There may be multipe c ; spec elements present in the same instruction, e.g. 1;rgb:10/20/30;2;rgb:a0/b0/c0.
